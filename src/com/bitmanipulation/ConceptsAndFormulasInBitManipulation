1) For any odd number A then, A & 1 = 1, in other words, if (A & 1 = 1, then A is odd)
2) For any even number A then, A & 1 = 0, if (A & 1 = 0, then A is even)

*********************** Bitwise operators *******************
1) a & 0 = a
2) a & a = a
3) a | 0 = a
4) a | a = a
5) a ^ 0 = a
6) a ^ a = 0
7) a ^ b = b ^ a
7) a & b = b & a
8) a | b = b | a
9) a & b & c = b & a & c = b & c & a , so on and so forth (distributive property)
10) a | b | c = b | a | c = c | a | b, so on and so forth (distributive property)
11) a ^ b ^ c = b ^ c ^ a = a ^ c ^ b, so on and so forth (distributive property)
12 a ^ b = (a & b) ^ (a | b)

II) Left shift operator:

If the number a is left shifted N times then the result = a * 2^N (till no overflow happens in the sense that the number after the overflow does
not fall outside the range of the data type,
A) For byte: the result after left shift operation should lie in range of -2^7 to 2^7 - 1
B) For short: the result after left shift operation should lie in range of -2^15 to 2^15 - 1
C) For int: the result after left shift operation should lie in range of -2^31 to 2^31 - 1
D) For long: the result after left shift operation should lie in range of -2^63 to 2^63 - 1

III) Right shift operator

For a number a, the value of a / 2^N = a >> N (right shift operator) and there is no concept of overflow in this case

IV) Special property on & operator:

If N is a power of 2, then N & (N-1) = 0 (Eg: If N is 2, 4, 8, 16 etc)
