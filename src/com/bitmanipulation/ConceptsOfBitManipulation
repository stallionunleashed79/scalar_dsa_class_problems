1) For any odd number x, x & 1 = 1, in other words -> if x & 1 = 0, then x is even -> Faster than modulus operator to check for even / odd
2) For any even number x, x & 1 = 0, in other words -> if x & 1 = 1, then x is odd -> Faster than modulus operator to check for even / odd
3) Bitwise operator properties:
A) X & 0 = 0
B) X & X = X
C) X | 0 = X
D) X | X = X
E) X ^ 0 = X
F) X ^ X = 0
G) X & Y = Y & X
H) X | Y = Y | X
I) X & Y & Z = Y & X & Z = X & Z & Y
3) For any binary number, the Most Significant Bit (MSB) is always negative
4) For any binary number of N bits, the range of number is from -2^(n-1) to 2^N-1 - 1
